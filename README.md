# HyperJob-Agency-Project
A practice project introducing to the Django framework within Python.
The project is a simple HTML styled job portal in which you can sign up, log in/out, post resumes and vacancies,
as well as a profile page, which shows all the posts the user made. Furthermore, authentication was used
to not only register users, but to verify that they have the correct credentials in order to make a post 
(management were permitted to do anything, whereas a simple user could only post resumes).

# Skills gained:
- Django & MVC theory
- HTML and how it is connected with Views.py files
- Small introduction into CSS to style my HTML templates as well as some Bootstrap
- Understanding databases and general CRUD utilizations
- Managing many different files interconnected to build one big project, which was quite difficult initially
- Building templates and admin functionality
- Debugging
- Creating routes via urls.py files

# TL;DR:
Learned many different framework skills, and reinforced many other skills I've already developed.
